WesBos JS 30 Day Challenge

Track my journey as I go through 30 days of coding challenged via WesBos courses!

## How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
Javascript is an extremely powerful tool and one must practice, practice, practice to be able to fully take advantage of all this amazing programming language has to offer. 
In this coding challenge I mastered array methods such as reduce(), sort(), splice(), slice(), map(), filter(), and more. I learned that you can do just about anything you could image with an array using these methods.
